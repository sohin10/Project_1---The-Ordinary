# PROJECT 1- MILESTONE 4 


Based on my original prototype design, I believe I've completed 80% of what I set out to do. 
The objective of my first job was to design a landing page for The Ordinary, an ecommerce website. It was my interpretation of how I intended the landing page's scrolling motion to display the brand name and product. 

The Apple website, which has a similar idea in which items unveil themselves with text animation to create an interesting user experience, served as inspiration for this project. 

This notion was absolutely foreign to me, and I had never done anything like before. To understand how to produce the animation, I viewed a lot of YouTube tutorials and researched a variety of methods. I then followed several instructions and modified my code accordingly. 


I originally accepted the task of making a stop-motion animation film of the bottle to kick off my complete design. I used a corkboard as my background and several boxes as my tripod to create a little photographic studio. This was also the first time I have filmed a stop motion video which was pretty awesome. I then integrated the mp4 file containing the video into the code. 

I then addressed the code. I discovered a new tool, the cdnjs libraries, for incorporating scroll motion into the code. Allowing me to additionally deal with text animation. I also learnt how you could shuffle between multiple pictures and how to apply minor animations to these images. The CSS portion of the code was straightforward. I learnt a lot more about javascript and how various syntaxes work. I first determined how to synchronize my video with the scroll bar and how the scroll bar matches to the length of the video. This was a fascinating discovery that allowed me to animate my text such that its opacity varies on scroll to expose itself with the video. The most difficult aspect was figuring out how to link the mp4 video to the scroll bar. Another problem was that my video won't render correctly when I launched it and it would frustrate me because I didn't know whether the video was functioning along with the scroll or not which later Preetam and others advised me to comment out some data that is being logged into the console, which is causing the transition to be sluggish; thus, I discovered the problem and commented it out, which has made my video more smooth. 

I was pleased with my landing page/splash screen design and quite proud to have created it just as I had imagined. However, I want the challenge of adding an extra page, so I created a Product description page. 

I wanted to develop a button that reads "Explore Product" after the landing page animation is complete and the scroll bar reaches the bottom of the page. Clicking this button would send you to a new page where you may see the product. 

I incorporated several of the methods I learned in class, like as the various input kinds and how to navigate between photos, to the product page. 


This project pushed me to work with code I had never done before, which is my primary takeaway from it. Going through many blogs and youtube videos enabled me to develop a better grasp of javascript and how to leverage open source libraries to construct a website rather than constantly having to write from scratch. 

This project also helped me grasp my own aesthetics as a front end developer, and I anticipate working on ecommerce websites and similar projects in the future. 

My greatest concern was that I would give up and be unable to complete anything because I couldn't get my code to work. However, as I was persistent and kept going back and forth with it, I was able to see my errors in different ways, which allowed me to overcome these obstacles using various methods and trial and error (hence you see a lot of code that is commented out in my code). 

On my project, I received positive comments from both my professor and my classmates, which served as an excellent incentive to keep progressing. 
It was also extremely exciting to see what others had made and to be inspired by their work, which is a fantastic way to learn new things and gain fresh knowledge. 
Overall, I believe I had obstacles, but I gave my best to create something I am proud of. 

## NEW ADDITIONS TO THE DESIGN 
Today, I figured it out, made it work, and gained so much new knowledge! 

First, I worked on the product page since I deemed it uninteresting and wanted to improve it. I did not take a screenshot of the screen earlier, but the initial layout consisted of four photographs, text on the side, buttons, and no embellishments. 
The smaller photos would shuffle when clicked, but I wanted the background to also shift to correlate with the image selected. Hence learnt how to do that by creating a new function and calling both the functions on click in html which would perform the two functions at the same time. After I got it to working and had the background and other photos change on click, I used the same method to create a third function where the text would also change based on which product image was selected. 

Next, I returned to my landing page and determined how to make the "Explore Product" button appear from the bottom when the scroll reaches its conclusion. 
Then, I found out that it was not immediately apparent that scrolling was required when the website was first accessed. Consequently, I learnt how to animate a button including arrows to indicate to the user that they must scroll rather than click or wait for anything to happen. This was a lot of fun to design since it was the first time I used tags animation and keyframes. 


Finally, I modified the navigation bar and added additional links since it seemed quite bare. 

In conclusion, I acquired some new approaches while completing my project to make the website more interactive and visually appealing. I learnt how to embed many functions and call them simultaneously with a single button press. I learnt how to animate a button as well. When I attempted to alter the text using innerHTML, the whole layout of the product page was screwed up, and the background does not change simultaneously with the image. I persisted in working through my issues, reviewing and changing my code, and commenting things out until I eventually got everything to function flawlessly!
