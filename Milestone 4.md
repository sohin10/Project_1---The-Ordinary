# MILESTONE 4

Based on my original prototype design, I believe I've achieved 80% of what I set out to do. 
The objective of my first project was to design a landing page for The Ordinary, an ecommerce website. It was my interpretation of how I intended the landing page's scrolling motion to display the brand name and product. 

The Apple website, which has a similar idea in which things unveil themselves with text and productÂ animation to create an interesting user experience, served as inspiration for this project. 

This notion was absolutely foreign to me, and I had never done anything like before. To understand how to produce the animation, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials and explored a variety of approaches. I then followed several instructions and modified my code accordingly. 

To begin my complete design, I initially accepted the task of making a stop-motion animation film of the bottle. I used a cork board as a background and a collection of boxes as a photographic mini-studio. This was my first time shooting a stop-motion video, which was quite fun. I then integrated the mp4 file containing the video into the code. 

I then addressed the code. I discovered a new tool, the cdnjs libraries, for incorporating scroll motion into the code. Allowing me to additionally deal with text animation. In addition, I learnt how to shuffle between photos and create minor animations to these images. The CSS portion of the code was straightforward. I gained a deeper understanding of javascript and how different syntaxes functioned. I first determined how to synchronize my video with the scroll bar and how the scroll bar matches to the length of the video. This was a fascinating discovery that allowed me to animate my text such that its opacity varies on scroll to expose itself with the video. The most difficult aspect was figuring out how to link the mp4 video to the scroll bar. Another obstacle was that my video didn't render correctly when I started it, which irritated me since I wasn't sure if the video was functioning with the scroll or not. Preetam and others advised me to comment out certain data being logged into the console that is slowing down the transfer. 

I was pleased with my landing page/splash screen design and quite proud to have created it just as I had imagined. However, I want the challenge of adding an extra page, so I created a Product description page. 

The issue was that I wanted to design (and am still working out) a button that reads "Explore Product" after the landing page animation is complete, and that button would send the user to a different page where they may see the product (since I am still figuring out how to map the button onto the screen) 

I incorporated several of the methods I learned in class, like as the various input kinds and how to navigate between photos, to the product page. 


This project pushed me to work with code I had never done before, which is my primary takeaway from it. Going through many blogs and youtube videos enabled me to develop a better grasp of javascript and how to leverage open source libraries to construct a website rather than constantly having to write from scratch. 

This project also helped me grasp my own aesthetics as a front end developer, and I anticipate working on ecommerce websites and similar projects in the future. 

My greatest concern was that I would give up and be unable to complete anything because I couldn't get my code to work. However, as I was persistent and kept going back and forth with it, I was able to see my errors in different ways, which allowed me to overcome these obstacles using different methods and trial and error (hence you see a lot of code that is commented out in my code). 

On my project, I received positive comments from both my professor and my classmates, which served as an excellent incentive to keep progressing. 
It was also extremely exciting to see what others had made and to be inspired by their work, which is a fantastic way to learn new things and gain fresh knowledge. 
Overall, I believe I had obstacles, but I gave my best to create something I am proud of.
