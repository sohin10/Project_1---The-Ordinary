# Milestone 1

I struggled to choose what I wanted to make for this class's Project 1 assignment. Due to the web's abundance of information, resources, and sources of inspiration, it may be an overwhelming environment. However, this is what I like most about the Internet. I picked this course because I want to develop the ability (in which I am still dipping my toes) to produce great, intriguing, and engaging work so that my websites might one day serve as an inspiration and a resource for other novice web designers to learn from and grow from. 
I spend hours and hours on behance, dribble, instagram, youtube, and even tik tok browsing over amazing website designs, and by cool I mean EXTREMELY COOL website designs, despite the fact that I am still not proficient at it. 
I am still determining where I want to take my career, but based on my exploration and observation of what I am drawn to, I have a strong suspicion that I am interested in User Interface design and have a strong preference for minimalist designs and aesthetics. Not just minimalisms, but subtle or exaggerated animations on a website, app, or design of any kind also pique my interest. I've always had a passion for animation, and I want to include it into my works. When websites employ large, eye-catching pictures to make a statement, it also keeps me interested. The reason for this is my passion for photography. Having an eye for subtleties in photography and understanding how a snapshot or video may communicate a narrative without the need for accompanying language is, in my view, one of the most beautiful things to comprehend and experience. 

Due to the fact that the Project 1 brief allowed for the selection of any topic, I intend to design a landing page that incorporates the majority, if not all, of the aforementioned elements.


My inspiration comes from www.apple.com, one of my favorite websites. The way Apple has created their webpages is precisely what I want to do in the future. The flow of graphics driven by the scroll intrigues me and I believe it's an incredible technique to maintain user interest. I have always admired the notion of a gradual unveiling of information. Also, the manner in which the text is animated and movies are played in the background with an overlay of text is very intriguing to see while simultaneously learning and reading through the text to comprehend the product they are attempting to advertise to such a broad audience. 



### PROJECT IDEA:
For my project, I'd want to create a landing page for a skincare brand that has a minimalist look, with just the logo and a hamburger menu in the navigation bar. 
And for the homepage design, I want one of their serum bottles to open and show the brand name as you scroll down. Depending on how complex the code becomes, I may adjust it such that the name appears first and the serum container shuts as the user scrolls down. 
I am aware that I am biting off more than I can chew, but I want to use this as a challenge to learn new methods and develop a creative style. 

Javascript is such a strong and extensive programming language, and I want to use it to create animations using code. In Justin Gitlin's class from last year, I learnt a little bit about what javascript may be able to achieve with p5.js, and I'd want to see how I can combine some of my knowledge from that course as well.




### PROTOTYPE AND DESIGN: 
Before sketching the prototype, I made a list of what I intended to accomplish. This note only stated, MINIMALISM, PRODUCT, ENGAGING. 
Then I chose The Ordinary as my brand. The primary reason I chose to work with a product was because products provide enough opportunity to demonstrate creativity and diversity in design. My second source of inspiration was www.seed.com, a website I found onto while surfing the Internet. Additionally, they do a decent job with the scrolling animation. There is a portion of their product where a capsule shuts on scrolling. That is what I want to achieve. 
I discovered via some investigation that the scroll animation is based on the notion of frame-by-frame animation. Consider a stop-motion animation, in which many frames are stitched together to generate a motion picture or a still image that, when assembled, resembles a video. Thus, each frame would be mapped to each time the scroll is enabled in this instance. As you scroll down, a new frame is added, creating a moving image on the screen. 
Another motivation for doing this was because I own the product and wanted to practice my photography abilities by taking the frame-by-frame photographs of the bottle myself for use on the website, as I couldn't locate what I needed. 

The scrolling motion is an excellent approach to convey information on both desktop and mobile screens. Therefore, it would be simple to make this website responsive. 
Having worked on my class portal website, I have understood that I must first design for a mobile (smaller) screen and then scale it up to meet a desktop resolution. 

Listed below is a prototype of how I want to create the website. I drew it out frame by frame and animated it, which gave me an idea of how I would attempt to do this using javascript. 


I want to focus only on the landing page and first brand introduction at this time. In the future, if I am able to do this successfully, I would want to build on this and maybe improve on the design and aesthetic I established, as well as overhaul the present website (www.theordinary.com). Or build an individual product page. 

In conclusion, my aims for this project are to learn and educate myself how to create extremely fascinating and captivating animations using javascript, and I feel that this is an excellent opportunity to exercise my imagination and push myself to produce something I've never made before.

# Milestone 2

In my second milestone, I began by designing a landing page and a prototype that mimicked the appearance of the real website. 
The design of my website is centered on how the page animates using the scroll bar. 
I generated a sequence of photos by first capturing stop-motion photographs of the product on a backdrop. 
I then imported them into Adobe Xd and placed each picture on a separate screen. Every time the user scrolls through, a new screen or the next picture in the sequence of photos will appear. After adding all the photos, I proceeded to add the text. 
As one scrolls down, the text would essentially reveal itself word by letter beside each picture. 


### Changes to initial design
While taking the photographs, I noticed that it was more efficient to take the shots by rolling the bottle instead of opening the bottle, as I illustrated in my earlier prototype for milestone 1. 
Initially, I intended to only create the animation where the landing page reveals the brand name and product without going into product detail. However, as I was creating the prototype, I decided to add an additional section where, once the brand name and product are revealed, the product rolls across the screen from right to left, hiding the brand name, and a product page will appear where the user can add the product to their cart and also the number of products they can purchase. 

Next, it will be essential to figure out how to deal with text animation on scroll and its opacity. For the final website, I will reshoot the photographs in better lighting, but for the time being, I will use the images that I have already taken to add them to the website and implement them in the code. 

### Future changes 
In addition to these modifications, when I reach the product page, I may add extra descriptions, buttons, and hover animations to other items or add a drop down menu option to increase the user experience of the website.
